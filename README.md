# LED Chaser — MPLAB X IDE

This repository contains an **MPLAB X IDE project** that implements a classic **LED chaser animation** on a PIC microcontroller using the **XC8 compiler**.

The “LED chaser” effect turns LEDs on one by one in a sequence (like chasing lights) and loops continuously.  
This is a fundamental embedded electronics example often used to learn GPIO control and delay timing.

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Configures multiple GPIO pins as **LED outputs**
- Lights each LED in a sequence with a delay
- Loops the pattern to create a “running” light effect

This pattern can be extended to:
- Change direction
- Add variable speed with buttons
- Integrate with interrupts
